          <p id="aboutMe"> Hello! My name is Kelly Lawlor and I am currently a Sophomore at NYU. </p>
          <p id="aboutMe">I've loved to read since I was young, and my love for stories led me to want to create my own.
            I write short stories mostly, and take inspiration for my work from the books, shows,
            movies and games I consume.
          </p>
          <p id="aboutMe">
            Some of my creative works have been published in my former high school's
            literary magazine, KEN Literary Magazine, and one of my poems has been published in
            The America Library of Poetry's poetry book, <i>Illustrious</i>.
          </p>
          <p id="aboutMe">
            Last year, I took my first writing class at NYU, Intermediate Fiction Workshop.
            I was the only freshman in my class which made me nervous, as I felt inexperienced
            in comparison to my peers. However, my classmates and professor have
            made me feel very welcome; they have given me many kind compliments on my work,
            as well as helpful critiques that will help me improve as a writer. Their support,
            as well as their own amazing written works, have inspired me in many ways.
