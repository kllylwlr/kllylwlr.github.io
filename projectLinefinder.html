			<h3>Problem</h3>

			<!-- Text -->
			<p>The Trillium LineFinder is a tool developed by the Oregon Health Plan
				that is used by medical providers to search through a prioritized list
				of services to determine if a line – the combination of an ICD code
				(representing a diagnosis) and a CPT code (representing a procedure) –
				is considered ‘above the line’, meaning it is payable by Medicare, or
				‘below the line’, meaning it is not.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p> The tool was originally built in 2011, and as a result it suffered
				from several security vulnerabilities and sported an outdated design.
				The goals of the redesign were to meet contemporary security standards;
				modernize the appearance of the UI; and identify pain points to make
				navigation of the tool more efficient and intuitive.

			<h3>Exploration of Original Tool</h3>
			<!-- Text -->
			<p>To identify pain points in the original tool, I first sought to explore
				and familiarize myself with it. Through my personal testing two pain
				points stood out to me.
			</p> <br>

			<h4> 1) Challenging Search Interface </h4>
			<p> There are three major use cases of the tool, corresponding to the three
				key ways to search: by an ICD and/or CPT code, by a line number, or by a
				guideline number.
			</p> <br>
			<p> However, in the original tool the fields to enter an ICD code, CPT
				code, line number and guideline all displayed on the same line, which
				had given me and other users the false impression that all fields must
				be filled to conduct a search, which was not the case.
			</p>

					<figcaption> Search bar of the original Trillium Line Finder tool </figcaption>
				</figure>
			</div>
			<br>

			<h4> 2) Difficulty Viewing Descriptions </h4>
			<p> In the original tool when searching for a line, its associated ICD and
				CPT codes displayed in a long vertical table which would often go
				offscreen and be difficult to skim. Additionally, there was no way to
				view the descriptions of each code, which was detrimental for users who
				wanted to further refine their search.

			<h3>Design Solutions</h3>
			<!-- Text -->
			<p>Once pain points were identified and validated with users, I moved onto
				the ideation stage.</p>

			<h4> 1) Reimagining the Search System </h4>
			<p> To clarify the confusion over the required search criteria created by
				putting all search fields on the same line, I devised a dropdown with
				three options corresponding to the four primary ways to search: by ICD
				and/or CPT code, by line number, by guideline number, and by keyword.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p> This dropdown offers a cleaner interface and reduces the user’s
				cognitive load, as search input fields are limited to those required for
				the selected type of search
			</p>
			<br>
			<p> For example: if a user selects ‘ICD and/or CPT code’ they will only be
				shown the ICD code field and CPT code field, but if they were to select
				‘line number’ they will only be shown a field to input the line number.
			</p>

				</figure>
			</div>
			<br>

			<h4> 2) Accessible Alternatives to Modal </h4>
			<p> To address the inability and lack of accessibility to view code
				descriptions, we designed accessible alternatives.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p> In the competitor tool, descriptions for codes related to a line are
				viewable by opening a collapsable table clicking on them. We wished to
				adopt this design pattern in our redesign, as it allowed users to quickly
				access and switch between code descriptions.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p> However, in the competitor, these descriptions displayed as modals -
				which are pop-up windows that grey out and disable interaction with the
				main page until they are closed.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p> This interaction posed accessibility concerns as blind users may not
				be notified a modal has appeared - and if not properly coded, modals
				cannot be read by a screen reader or closed by keyboard only.
			</p>

				</figure>
			</div>
			<br>

			<p> The devised alternative to modals was to have the descriptions display
				within the table beneath the list of codes when one of them was clicked.
			</p> <br>
			<p> This addressed the accessibility concerns of using a modal, and kept
				information easy to access and in-context.

			<h3>Usability Testing</h3>
			<!-- Text -->
			<p>After completion and approval of the initial wireframes, I arranged to
				conduct a usability test with super users.
			</p> <br>
			<p>In preparation of testing I created an interactable prototype for the
				users to click through to imitate how the final product would look and
				function. The immersive experience of this simulation was employed to
				promote more specific data and feedback from users. I also composed
				multiple use case scenario questions to prompt users to navigate to
				specific parts of the tool. These questions would give me the opportunity
				to observe a user’s journey firsthand, and note the participants’
				behaviors, goals, and pain points as they interacted with the product.
			</p> <br>

			<!-- Photo -->

					<figcaption> Interactive prototype of the redesigned Linefinder tool </figcaption>
				</figure>
			</div> <br>

			<p>During the usability test I took detailed notes on the user’s interactions
				with and comments on the prototype. As I observed the users’ actions
				throughout each scenario, I saw they were able to quickly navigate to the
				designated pages, signaling to me that the design was intuitive thus far.
				Users responded positively to the modernized look and organization of
				information, remarking that the design was clean, intuitive; and on the
				collapsable tables and in-table ICD and CPT descriptions, saying it made
				it much easier to search for things.
			</p> <br>

			<p>One point of constructive criticism made by the users was the request
				for a disclaimer about whether a specific line is fundable by Medicare.
			</p> <br>
			<p>During an initial meeting with users to understand the functionality of
				the tool, users had explained that all lines with line numbers below 470
				are fundable by Medicare, whereas those above are not fundable. However,
				during this test users clarified that lines marked as fundable can only
				be verified as fundable if all associated guidelines of the line are met
				by the practitioner.
			</p> <br>
			<p>In the past some users had assumed that any line marked as ‘above’ was
				fundable by Medicare, which led to confusion and medical practice issues.
				This feedback was indispensable and greatly appreciated. I quickly devised
				a solution to place a disclaimer explaining that lines are only payable
				if they are marketed as ‘above’ and meet guideline requirements above
				the line results table, so it would be visible to users every time they
				looked at a line.
